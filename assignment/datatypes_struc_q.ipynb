    "### 1. **What are data structures, and why are they important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data structures** are ways of organizing and storing data so that operations such as access, insertion, deletion, and modification can be performed efficiently. They are important because they allow for efficient data management and algorithm implementation, which improves performance and scalability of software.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mutable** types can be changed after creation.\n",
    "  Example: `list`, `dict`, `set`\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "  my_list[0] = 10  # List is changed\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* **Immutable** types cannot be changed after creation.\n",
    "  Example: `int`, `str`, `tuple`\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  my_str = \"hello\"\n",
    "  # my_str[0] = \"H\"  # This will raise an error\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",

    "### 3. **What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?**\n",

    "| Feature     | List                 | Tuple                      |\n",
    "| ----------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |\n",
    "| Mutability  | Mutable              | Immutable                  |\n",
    "| Syntax      | `[]`                 | `()`                       |\n",
    "| Performance | Slower               | Faster                     |\n",

    "### 4. **Describe how dictionaries store data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs in a **hash table**. Keys are hashed to determine their storage location, allowing for fast access.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a **set** to store **unique values** and to benefit from **faster lookup and membership testing** compared to lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **string** is an **immutable sequence** of characters, whereas a **list** is a **mutable sequence** of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "str1 = \"hello\"  # Immutable\n",
    "list1 = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']  # Mutable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are **immutable**, so once created, their values cannot be changed. This ensures the integrity of the data and prevents accidental modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **hash table** is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. Python’s dictionaries are implemented using hash tables to provide fast key-based access.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Can lists contain different data types in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Python lists are **heterogeneous**, meaning they can contain elements of different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, \"hello\", 3.14]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Explain why strings are immutable in Python.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are immutable to improve **performance**, **security**, and **hashing** (e.g., being used as dictionary keys). Any change to a string results in the creation of a new string object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Faster lookups** by key (O(1) vs O(n))\n",
    "* **More meaningful access** using keys\n",
    "* **Efficient data mapping**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. **Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When storing fixed data like coordinates or RGB values, use a tuple to prevent accidental changes.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. **How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets automatically **remove duplicates** and only store unique values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 2, 3}  # Result: {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. **How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* In **lists**, `\"in\"` checks for values.\n",
    "* In **dictionaries**, `\"in\"` checks for keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "2 in [1, 2, 3]  # True\n",
    "\"key\" in {\"key\": \"value\"}  # True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. **Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.**\n",
    "\n",
    "No. Tuples are **immutable**, so their elements cannot be changed after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16. **What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **nested dictionary** is a dictionary within another dictionary. Useful for representing hierarchical data like a student database.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "students = {\n",
    "    \"Alice\": {\"math\": 90, \"science\": 85},\n",
    "    \"Bob\": {\"math\": 80, \"science\": 78}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17. **Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing elements by key is **O(1)** on average due to the use of hash tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18. **In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* When **order** matters.\n",
    "* When **indexed access** is needed.\n",
    "* When storing a simple sequence of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19. **Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, dictionaries were unordered, meaning insertion order wasn't preserved. Since Python 3.7+, they preserve insertion order, but conceptually they're still **unordered mappings**, meaning element position isn't guaranteed for logical access.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20. **Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **List**: Access by **index** (position).\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  my_list[0]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* **Dictionary**: Access by **key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  my_dict[\"key\"]\n",
    "  ```\n",
