    "### 1. **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\" that contain both data (attributes) and code (methods). It helps structure programs into reusable, modular components.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **What is a class in OOP?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **What is an object in OOP?**\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. It has its own data and can perform actions defined by its class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Abstraction** hides complexity and shows only the essential features.\n",
    "* **Encapsulation** hides the internal state by restricting direct access (e.g., using private variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **What are dunder methods in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dunder methods (like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__len__`) are special methods with double underscores used to define behavior for built-in operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Explain inheritance in OOP.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance lets one class (child) inherit attributes and methods from another (parent), promoting code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism allows the same interface or method name to behave differently based on the object or class it is used with.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is done using access modifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `_var` is protected (convention).\n",
    "* `__var` is private (name mangled).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **What is a constructor in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__()` method is a constructor that gets called automatically when an object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **What are class and static methods in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class methods** (`@classmethod`) take `cls` as the first argument and can access class-level data.\n",
    "* **Static methods** (`@staticmethod`) don’t access class or instance data; they are utility functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **What is method overloading in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn't support method overloading natively. Instead, you can use default parameters or `*args`/`**kwargs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. **What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Overriding is when a subclass provides a new version of a method inherited from a parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. **What is a property decorator in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@property` decorator allows a method to be accessed like an attribute, used to implement getters/setters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. **Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows flexibility and reuse of code, making it easier to extend and maintain large programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. **What is an abstract class in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract class (defined using `ABC` and `@abstractmethod`) cannot be instantiated and must be subclassed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16. **What are the advantages of OOP?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code reuse via inheritance\n",
    "* Encapsulation for data protection\n",
    "* Abstraction for simplicity\n",
    "* Polymorphism for flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17. **Difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class variable**: shared by all instances.\n",
    "* **Instance variable**: unique to each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18. **What is multiple inheritance in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class inherits from more than one parent class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class A: pass\n",
    "class B: pass\n",
    "class C(A, B): pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19. **Purpose of `__str__()` and `__repr__()`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__str__()` is for human-readable output (`print()`).\n",
    "* `__repr__()` is for unambiguous representation (debugging, logging).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20. **Significance of `super()` in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "`super()` is used to call methods of a parent class, often inside `__init__()` in inheritance scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 21. **Significance of `__del__()` method?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a destructor method called when an object is deleted or garbage collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 22. **Difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `@staticmethod`: no access to class or instance (`self`, `cls` not used).\n",
    "* `@classmethod`: gets class (`cls`) as the first argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 23. **How does polymorphism work with inheritance in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A child class can override a parent class method, and the correct method is called based on the object’s class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 24. **What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s calling multiple methods in a single line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "obj.method1().method2().method3()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method must return `self`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 25. **Purpose of `__call__()` method in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Allows an object to be called like a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __call__(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Called!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = MyClass()\n",
    "obj()  # Output: \"Called!\"\n",
    "```\n",
